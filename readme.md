# Benjamin Lehmann

I'm a student at the University of Alberta pursuing a BSc in Computing Science. I've been writing software since I was 10 but I didn't start to write anything of quality until high school. In the summer of 2019 I got an internship at a software consulting company where I decided that this was what I wanted as a career. Around this time I also started to make contributions to open source software.
